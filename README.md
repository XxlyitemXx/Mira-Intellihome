## About The Project

Intellihome is a Python-based smart home system designed to understand and respond to your needs through voice commands, gestures, and facial recognition. Powered by Google's Gemini Pro and leveraging the power of OpenCV and Mediapipe, Intellihome seamlessly integrates into your daily life, making it easier and more comfortable.

### Features

* **Natural Language Processing:** Interact with Mira, your AI assistant, using natural language to get information, set reminders, and control smart devices.
* **Gesture Recognition:** Use simple hand gestures to control various aspects of your home environment.
* **Facial Recognition:** Intellihome can recognize you and personalize settings based on your preferences.
* **OpenWeatherMap Integration:**  Get real-time weather updates for your location.
* **Continuously Learning:** Intellihome adapts and learns your habits over time to provide a personalized experience.
